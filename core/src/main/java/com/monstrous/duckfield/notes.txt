Objective is to render instanced models, loaded from gltf files, both on desktop (lwgl3) and on web (teamvm).


IMPORTANT:
When exporting gltf from Blender use GLTF Separate.  You will get a .gltf file a .bin file and possibly some texture files.
GLTF Embedded works on desktop but not on web.


Note:
- using a pallette may be preferable to giving parts of the mesh different fixed colours, because the latter options creates a mesh per material and a texture switch.

On lwgl3 we need OpenGL 4.3 for full compatibility with GLES 3.0
So for GLES3.0 compatibility we need to call:

        configuration.setOpenGLEmulation(Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration.GLEmulation.GL30, 4,3); // use OpenGL4.3 to emulate GLES3.0
